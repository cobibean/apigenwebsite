# 1

Hey Sunny,

Quick progress note on Apigen:

Phase 1 is complete.
We rebuilt the project in our dev stack and set the foundations so we can move quickly from here. In plain English:

Pages are now built from reusable sections (“blocks”), so updates are fast and consistent.

A simple content setup is wired in, which lets us preview pages safely while we build.

Base styles, fonts, and SEO defaults are in place.

Accessibility and performance guardrails are on by default.

You won’t see visual changes yet—that starts next. This foundation is what lets us plug in a visual editor later (if you want) without rework.

Next up (Phase 2):

Build the real Hero section (photo/video, headline, CTA).

Build the Customer Journey section (clean, interactive walkthrough).

Start assembling the Home page with those sections, then move into About/Brands.

I’ll keep shipping and send the next update as soon as the Hero + Journey are live in the build. If you have any change requests as we go, just shoot them over and we’ll fold them in.
