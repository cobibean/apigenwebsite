3 things: 

1. Nav Bar/Header
2. Background video
3. Journey cards



Now I need to add our hero video. This will be our background for above the fold.

The hero section needs to take up 100% of the above the fold section. Currently the hero takes up about 75% and it looks ameturish. 

So add the video and fix the view so on any device, the hero section takes up 100% of the screen until the user scrolls down. 

The video is in @public/hero
