Apigen Sprint Plan â€” 2025-10-25 (5h Focus)

Goals
- Knock out low-hanging UX/visual polish and small content tasks.
- Queue one medium task if time permits.

Scope (Tonight)
- Brands page spacing/pass
  - Tweak vertical rhythm and card spacing on `/brands`.
  - Ensure hero/content align to navbar offset utilities.

- Navbar/logo sizing
  - Slightly increase logo size in header (desktop + mobile) without layout shift.

- Footer disclaimer placeholder
  - Add a footer disclaimer slot with placeholder copy and prop, ready to swap when client provides final text.

- Replace hero BG with image (toggleable)
  - Allow hero to switch from video to provided 16:9 image via prop/flag for quick A/B.

- Card hover polish (3D-lite)
  - Add subtle perspective/raise hover to About/Brands cards respecting reduced motion.

Medium (if time allows)
- Contact modal (UI only)
  - Modal with fields: Name, Company, Email, Country, Message (required), client-side validation, and success state.
  - No storage integration yet.

Out of Scope (Tonight)
- Form backend (Google Sheets/API)
- New SVG logo production
- Age-gate modal
- Visual editor refactor
